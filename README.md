# RSES-DataScience

RSES-DataScience is a Github group/organisation, to which we can add projects / libraries. Feel free to add your projects if you want to.

You can either fill issues to ask adding / modifying contents, or fork the repository if your feeling to do some modifications yourself. For further information about the later process, I found this page quite useful: https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/

If you want to modify things yourself, the steps are basically quite simple:

- If you don’t have one, create a github profile;
- fork the rses-datascience.github.io to you Github profile and clone it to your local computer;
- modify anything you want;
- see you modifications by running locally jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) with the command "bundle exec jekyll serve” in a terminal pointing to your local copy of the folder. You can see the modifications in your browser pointing to the local address indicated by the jekyll command;
- once you are happy with your work, commit and push your local copy to your remote repository (see above link for command details);
- create a pull request from your remote Github copy webpage, as indicated in the link provided above.

Please let me know if you need any further information, and we will wait for your suggestions and contents!

ps: please also keep in mind that, as anything on our github repository is presently public, the issues also should not contain any “confidential” information.
